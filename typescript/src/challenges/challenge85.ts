/*

Task
Your task is to write a function which returns the n-th term of the following series, which is the sum of the first n terms of the sequence (n is the input parameter).

Series: 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 + 1/16 + â€¦

You will need to figure out the rule of the series to complete this.

Rules
You need to round the answer to 2 decimal places and return it as String.

If the given value is 0 then it should return "0.00".

You will only be given Natural Numbers as arguments.

Examples (Input --> Output)
n
1 --> 1 --> "1.00"
2 --> 1 + 1/4 --> "1.25"
5 --> 1 + 1/4 + 1/7 + 1/10 + 1/13 --> "1.57"

*/

// ==> My Solution:

export function SeriesSum(n:number):string {
  let nthTerm = 0;
  for(let num = 0; num < n; num++){
    nthTerm += 1/(3 * num + 1);
  }

  return nthTerm.toFixed(2);
}
