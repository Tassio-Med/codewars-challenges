// The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!

// Example output:

// Hello, Mr. Spock

// ==> My solution:

export function sayHello(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
}
