/* In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.

Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).

The function needs to return either a true or false.

Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.

Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata. */

// ==> My solution:

public class Number
{
  public bool IsEven(double n) => n % 2 == 0;
  
}
